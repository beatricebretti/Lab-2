# Lab-2
- Created my first app using Ruby on Rails, named `Writter`. Also used Bootstrap, CSS, HTML, and PostgreSQL. 
- To run the application, on the `/writter` directory run: 
```
rails server
```
# Lab-3
- Go to the [Wiki](https://github.com/beatricebretti/Lab-2/wiki) to see the User Stories and more.

# Lab-4
- Created the 3 independent models (and tables) `User`, `Post`, `Comment`.

# Lab-5
- Created associations between `Posts` and `Comments`.
- Created `Index` and `Show` actions for the `Post`, so now they are available with their respective comments.
